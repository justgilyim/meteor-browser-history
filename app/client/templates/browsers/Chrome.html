            <p>Google's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> opposed the development of
                an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company," and
                he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars." After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page
                hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted
                that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."</p>
